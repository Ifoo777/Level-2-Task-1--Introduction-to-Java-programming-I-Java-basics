# Level 2 Task 1 -Introduction to Java programming I: Java basics

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Create a new file called highRoller.java

● You are going to create a game where you play against the program. You will simulate you and the program each rolling a 6-side dice and see who rolls the highest number. The best of three rounds wins.

● The program should randomly generate a number between 1 and 6 to represent the roles of the dice (Hint: look up Math.random)

● The program should then prompt the user to ‘roll their dice’.

● Once the user has ‘rolled their dice’, the program should print both numbers and inform the user whether they win, lose or draw.

● The best of three rounds wins.

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● Create a new file called prime.java

● Write a program that determines if a number entered by a user is a prime number.

● Prompt the user to enter a positive integer.

● Then calculate if the number is prime (i.e. it only has factors of 1 and itself).

● Finally, print out the number and state whether or not it is a prime number.
